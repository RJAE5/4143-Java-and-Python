### 10-9-2025 Python Tuples

Tuples are immutable and have pretty much the same set of methods that strings have. To "edit" a tuple, you must create a new tuple, often using slicing. 

You can return tuples in functions, which is similar to multivariable assignment.

Tuples can be "scattered" using `*tupleName` which spreads out the elements.

The `zip` function takes 2+ sequences and "zips" them together, meaning it combines them into a tuple of items resembling key-value pairs.

Traversing tuples is pretty interesting, you just assign different iterator values.
