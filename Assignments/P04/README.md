## P04 - Movie Ratings
### Rykir Evans
### Description:

This program takes a list of movie ratings from an external file and creates a report file that tracks all scores, including duplicates, and calculates the average. Additionally, the highest scoring movie and its score are output at the end.

### Usage:
To use this program, a file `ratings.txt` should be prepared with movie titles and ratings in the format `Movie Title,X` where `X` is the integer rating. Once `ratings.txt` has been prepared, run through program using a standard python interpreter and a file `report.txt` will be prepared formatted with all rating information.
