## PR1 - Python is Awesome Presentation
### Rykir Evans
### Description:

This program exhibits the numerous functions of the Python PIL/Pillow library, with this particular snippet focusing on orientation, brightness, and contrast using images of real scenes from the San Diego Balboa Park Botanical Gardens. Another snippet focusing on other methods may be found on [Victoria Heredia's Repo](https://github.com/vicky04edx/4143-Java-Python/tree/main/Assignments/PythonIsAwesome) as this was a group project. Further, please reference [our slideshow](./PR1_Slide_Show.pdf) for the presentation aspect.

### Usage
To use this program, ensure the files within the directory are saved with proper names, or alter the `.open()` commands to open other specified files. The exhibition style of this snippet is not designed to be extremely customizable, so all changes must occur within the code.
